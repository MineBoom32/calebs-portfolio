                Hello! My name is Caleb Moretti, and I am an aspiring game developer looking to enter the indie scene. I am currently a student at IUPUI aiming for a degree in Media Arts and Science. You can sometimes find me coding in my spare time as well as tinkering with other 2d graphics tools like Paint.net and Adobe Illustrator. I have quite a bit of experience working with Paint.net, Roblox Studio, and Stencyl, as well as the JavaScript programming language and p5.js. I also have a decent understanding of Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and MagicaVoxel among other tools. I am looking to expand my horizons and start developing with more serious tools, though I have yet to really become familiar with them. I am always willing to try new things, and I'm usually ready for a challenge whenever it presents itself.
